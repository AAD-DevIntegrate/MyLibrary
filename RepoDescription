#        My Swift Library

 // Here are the install files for builds using swift dependencies.
   Auto After Dark repository for building swift apps for the business.
  If all testing and development go well, hopefully the end production environment runs and 
 app for businesses and service  workers in the automotive industry.
 
 // This development is meant to help automotive technicians, service writers and partnerred
  freelancers, entreprenuers, and B2B employees work without endless paper documentation for
 inspections, uploading photos related to vehicle service recommendations, and creating estimates
for clients and billing using PayPal products for processing credit cards and using tools like ones below.
 
### Virutal Terminal
 
##  PayflowPro SDK

##  PayPal Credit and Paylater

##  Client and Server Side Java Integrations

##  Developer Sandbox tools integrations:

    Venmo payments
    Apple Pay
    Braintree SDK
    Radio buttons and smart buttons

##  Payflow Gateway

As a reminder and forwarning. A lot of the attempts to violate service terms on PayPal's production environment
was a group of cyber criminals that are not affiliated with this organizational effort and due to a conflict of interest
a lot of this open source project with be done off the server and privately. It has been brought to my attention
that some local agents have seemingly reported wrong information about myself and select individuals that are misrepresented
and slanderous in nature. No names will be mention on here, but be advise - a certain open source project on Apple products as well as Microsoft operating systems have been used in the worst way. The reason this is mentioned does not really pertain to development of this swift repository but 
I feel it is necessary to put out here since github is used globally. I have a lot of indications and I am sure others may have experienced this 
as well, that these people have invaded the privacy of of those who did not have the best reputation. This is very disturbing to me since this topic is relatedd to an app that is currently on the market. 

A lot of people got involved and I am certain that a lot of questions are going unanswered since this app is not so well known to people who are busy and the fact that there are still people that aren't glued to their phones or computers like most of us usually are. But I am almost 100% positive court administrators and judicial officers and private firms who recieved funding for fighting against crime and corruption have been using this software to spy in on civilians who might be oblivious to what the capabilities come with this app. Although, I may not be very skilled at writing code and a person who weilds power or authority, the people of less fortune have a big problem in this matter. A constitutional right that I place a big value on is violated. And this is being endorsed by authority figures and even officials working corporation commission, legislation the senate and probably even the governor. I fear that what I was using to remotely access my Mac when not home is used to commit crime that are biased and fraudulent and use to use personal and financial information for sabotage and extortion.
